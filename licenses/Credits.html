					GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
					Version 3, 29 June 2007

					Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
						Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
						of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


						This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
						the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
						License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

						0. Additional Definitions.

						As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
						General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
						General Public License.

						"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
						other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

						An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
						by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
						Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
						of using an interface provided by the Library.

						A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
						Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
						with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
						Version".

						The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
						Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
						for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
						based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

						The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
						object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
						and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
						Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

						1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

						You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
						without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

						2. Conveying Modified Versions.

						If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
						facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
						that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
						facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
						version:

						a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
						ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
						function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
						whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

						b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
						this License applicable to that copy.

						3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

						The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
						a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
						code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
						material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
						layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
						(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

						a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
						Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
						covered by this License.

						b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
						document.

						4. Combined Works.

						You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
						taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
						portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
						engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
						the following:

						a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
						the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
						covered by this License.

						b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
						document.

						c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
						execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
						these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
						copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

						d) Do one of the following:

						0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
						License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
						suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
						recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
						the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
						manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
						Corresponding Source.

						1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
						Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
						a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
						system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
						of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
						Version.

						e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
						be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
						GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
						necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
						Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
						Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
						you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
						the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
						Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
						Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
						for conveying Corresponding Source.)

						5. Combined Libraries.

						You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
						Library side by side in a single library together with other library
						facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
						License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
						choice, if you do both of the following:

						a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
						on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
						conveyed under the terms of this License.

						b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
						is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
						accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

						6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

						The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
						of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
						versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
						differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

						Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
						Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
						of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
						applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
						conditions either of that published version or of any later version
						published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
						received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
						General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
						General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

						If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
						whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
						apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
						permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
						Library.

										GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
										Version 2, June 1991

										Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
										59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
										Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
										of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

										Preamble

										The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
										freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
										License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
										software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
										General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
										Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
										using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
										the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
										your programs, too.

										When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
										price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
										have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
										this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
										if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
										in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

										To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
										anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
										These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
										distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

										For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
										gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
										you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
										source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
										rights.

										We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
										(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
										distribute and/or modify the software.

										Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
										that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
										software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
										want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
										that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
										authors' reputations.

										Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
										patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
										program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
										program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
										patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

										The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
										modification follow.

										GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
										TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

										0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
										a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
										under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
										refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
										means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
										that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
										either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
										language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
										the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

										Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
										covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
										running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
										is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
										Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
										Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

										1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
										source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
										conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
										copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
										notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
										and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
										along with the Program.

										You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
										you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

										2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
										of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
										distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
										above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

										a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
										stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

										b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
										whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
										part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
										parties under the terms of this License.

										c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
										when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
										interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
										announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
										notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
										a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
										these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
										License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
										does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
										the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

										These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
										identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
										and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
										themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
										sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
										distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
										on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
										this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
										entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

										Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
										your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
										exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
										collective works based on the Program.

										In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
										with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
										a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
										the scope of this License.

										3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
										under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
										Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

										a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
										source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
										1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

										b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
										years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
										cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
										machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
										distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
										customarily used for software interchange; or,

										c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
										to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
										allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
										received the program in object code or executable form with such
										an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

										The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
										making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
										code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
										associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
										control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
										special exception, the source code distributed need not include
										anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
										form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
										operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
										itself accompanies the executable.

										If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
										access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
										access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
										distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
										compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

										4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
										except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
										otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
										void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
										However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
										this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
										parties remain in full compliance.

										5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
										signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
										distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
										prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
										modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
										Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
										all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
										the Program or works based on it.

										6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
										Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
										original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
										these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
										restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
										You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
										this License.

										7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
										infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
										conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
										otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
										excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
										distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
										License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
										may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
										license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
										all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
										the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
										refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

										If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
										any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
										apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
										circumstances.

										It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
										patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
										such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
										integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
										implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
										generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
										through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
										system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
										to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
										impose that choice.

										This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
										be a consequence of the rest of this License.

										8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
										certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
										original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
										may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
										those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
										countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
										the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

										9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
										of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
										be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
										address new problems or concerns.

										Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
										specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
										later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
										either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
										Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
										this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
										Foundation.

										10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
										programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
										to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
										Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
										make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
										of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
										of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

										NO WARRANTY

										11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
										FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
										OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
										PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
										OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
										MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
										TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
										PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
										REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

										12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
										WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
										REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
										INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
										OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
										TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
										YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
										PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
										POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

										END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

										How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

										If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
										possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
										free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

										To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
										to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
										convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
										the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

										<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
